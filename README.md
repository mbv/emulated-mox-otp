# Emulated MOX OTP

Emulate interface of MOX CPU cryptographic device (called OTP), just using router fs


Python library to query MOX CPU cryptographic device (called OTP).

OTP device has permanent read-only memory to store data during production. It
contains information about *serial number*, *MAC address*, etc. It also contains
*ECDSA* private key and have interface to sign 512-bits long message (generally
